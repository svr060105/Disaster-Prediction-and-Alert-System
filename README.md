<h1>Cyclone Prediction Model<h1/>
<h2>Overview<h2/>
This repository contains the code and dataset for our cyclone prediction model developed as part of [Hackathon Name/Project Name]. The goal of this project is to predict cyclones using machine learning techniques and real-time weather data.
<br>
Project Structure
cyclone_dataset/
cyclone/: Contains cyclone-related data.
noncyclone/: Contains non-cyclone-related data for comparison.

cyclone.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for model development and evaluation.

cyclone_databased_on_weather.csv: Dataset used for training and testing, based on weather parameters.

<h2>Key Features: <h2/>
Data Integration: Real-time weather data integration using OpenWeatherMap API.

Model Development: Machine learning models for cyclone prediction.

Alert System: Twilio-based SMS alert system for early warnings.

<h2>Getting Started<h2/>
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure Python and necessary libraries are installed (requirements.txt will be provided if applicable).
Open and run cyclone.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
