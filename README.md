# Cyclone Prediction Model

## Overview
This repository contains the code and dataset for our cyclone prediction model developed as part of [Hackathon Name/Project Name]. The goal of this project is to predict cyclones using machine learning techniques and real-time weather data.

### Project Structure
- **cyclone_dataset/**
  - **cyclone/**: Contains cyclone-related data.
  - **noncyclone/**: Contains non-cyclone-related data for comparison.
- **cyclone.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the code for model development and evaluation.
- **cyclone_databased_on_weather.csv**: Dataset used for training and testing, based on weather parameters.

## Key Features:
- **Data Integration**: Real-time weather data integration using OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Model Development**: Machine learning models for cyclone prediction.
- **Alert System**: Twilio-based SMS alert system for early warnings.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python and necessary libraries are installed (requirements.txt will be provided if applicable).
3. Open and run `cyclone.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
